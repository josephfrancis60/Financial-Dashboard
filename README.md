## Introduction ðŸŒŸ  
The *Financial Dashboard* project is a robust and dynamic solution for analyzing key financial metrics such as income, savings, expenses, and financial growth trends over time. Built using *Power BI*, the dashboard is designed to offer real-time insights, interactive visualizations, and intuitive controls, enabling users to make well-informed financial decisions. This project addresses the common challenges of managing finances using static methods like spreadsheets and demonstrates the power of visual analytics in simplifying complex data.

## How the Dashboard Was Created ðŸ›   

### Data Collection ðŸ“…  
The dataset comprised income, expenses, savings, and targets recorded over different dates. Initially, dates were represented as columns, making it difficult to analyze trends.

#### Data Transformation Steps:  
1. *Unpivoted Columns*:  
   - Converted date columns into rows using *Power BIâ€™s unpivot feature* for better row-wise analysis.  
2. *Created Calculated Columns*:  
   - *Year*:
     ```DAX
     Year = FORMAT('Dataset'[Date],"yyyy")
       
   - *Month-Year*:  
     ```DAX
     Month-Yr = FORMAT('Dataset'[Date],"mmm-yy")

### Visualizations ðŸ“ˆ  
1. *Line Chart*:  
   - Tracks trends in expense percentages, savings percentages, and targets over time.  
2. *Donut Charts*:  
   - Displays proportions of savings and expenses for quick insights.  
3. *Matrix Table*:  
   - Categorizes data by year and type, providing detailed breakdowns.  
4. *KPI Cards*:  
   - Summarizes metrics such as total income, total expenses, total savings, and expense-to-savings ratio.  
5. *Dynamic Slicers*:  
   - Users can filter data by year or specific categories, enhancing interactivity.
